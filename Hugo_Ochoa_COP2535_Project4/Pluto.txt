Pluto’s mean distance from the Sun is about 5.9 billion km 3.7 billion miles or 39.5 astronomical units. This gives it an orbit larger than that of the outermost planet Neptune. One astronomical unit [AU] is the average distance from Earth to the Sun which is about 150 million km or 93 million miles. Its orbit compared with those of the planets is atypical in several ways. It is more elongated and eccentric than any of the planetary orbits and more inclined about 17.1° to the ecliptic to the plane of Earth’s orbit near which the orbits of most of the planets lie. In traveling its eccentric path around the Sun Pluto varies in distance from 29.7 AU at its closest point to the Sun which makes it a perihelion. At 49.5 AU at its farthest point it becomes aphelion. Because Neptune orbits in a nearly circular path at 30.1 AU Pluto is for a small part of each revolution actually closer to the Sun than is Neptune. The two bodies will never collide because Pluto is locked in a stabilizing resonance with Neptune.  That is it completes two orbits around the Sun in exactly the time it takes Neptune to complete three. This gravitational interaction affects their orbits such that they can never pass closer than about 17 AU. The last time Pluto reached perihelion occurred in 1989. For about 10 years before that time and again afterward, Neptune was more distant than Pluto from the Sun.
